**A system is developed wherein as a student enters the class in the first period, his/her face will be recognised by the CCTV camera and the student will be registered as present in the class. The name of the student will be displayed on the LCD screen(placed above the blackboard), so that he/she can know that their attendance has been recorded. Immediately, their parents will also receive a message that their wards have reached the school, and thus students won’t be able to bunk the school and also will ensure parents that they have safely reached the school premises. Once the attendance has been marked in the first period, it will be notified (saved), so that it can help other teachers for verification. The number of students currently present in the class will continuously be displayed on the display board (LCD). For marking the presence of the wards in the class at proper time it is required that they get their attendance marked before the entry of the teacher(teacher may provide them 10 minutes relaxation). The face of the teacher will also be recognised and once the teacher enters the class, the camera will be closed and none of the student will get attendance after that. The total student tally, will vary depending on the current number of students present inside the classroom. The student’s entry and exit will be monitored and tracked to keep updating the number of students present in the class at the moment. Each day’s information regarding the total number of students present and absent will be stored and maintained in a database(firestore database). If a particular student is falling short of attendance for example less than 75 percent then, a message will be conveyed regarding it to their parents. The class teacher will be given Admin Access to the portal (wherein attendance is being uploaded), in case of any query or issue related to attendance one can directly contact their respective class teacher.
